my-brood
========

The design for my-brood has been shamelessly adapted from Github boxen's our-boxen repository.

This and all hatchery projects are named from concepts related to the fictional alien race, Zerg.
Broods in Zerg terms are a group of genetically similar Zerg that are all hatched from the same
area with a focused purpose.
The Zerg species adapts by having a large array of genetic diversity accross broods and using genetic advantage.
Your brood is your computer and computers like it.
Your brood may be like mine, but it may not.
Fork my brood to create genentic modifications for your own purposes and go forth and conquor the galaxy.
